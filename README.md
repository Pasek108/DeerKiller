# DeerKiller Readme
<details>
  <summary>❓Why the page is not loading❓</summary>
  Due to usage of PHP and MySQL for saving the best scores I had to use hosting with support for this technology. 
  I have no money so I used a free hosting which unfortunately puts websites to sleep. Juts wait a few minutes and it should work.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓Why sounds starts playing after first click and not when I open the page❓</summary>
  It's because auto playing sounds is blocked by browser until the user interact with the document.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓Why my commits often have no names❓</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I tend to create with bursts many things at once</li>
    <li>Sometimes I have bad internet connection and I can't send separate commits</li>
    <li>Describing commits doesn't matter when I'm coding alone</li>
  <ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓Why am I using only one branch❓</summary>
  It's for the similar reasons as with commits.  
  <ul>
    <li>I do many things at once</li>
    <li>I don't plan things ahead, I just go in and create things that seems good</li>
    <li>I'm coding alone so I know the code and there is nothing I can break</li>
  <ul>
